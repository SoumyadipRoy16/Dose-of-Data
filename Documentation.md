# Pokémon Dataset Analysis Documentation

## Introduction

This document serves as documentation for the Pokémon Dataset Analysis project. It provides an overview of the project's objectives, methodology, and key findings.

## Objectives

The main objectives of the project are as follows:
- Explore the Pokémon dataset to uncover insights about Pokémon attributes, types, and generations.
- Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize distributions and correlations within the dataset.
- Build predictive models to classify Pokémon as legendary or non-legendary based on their attributes.
- Present findings and insights with clear visualizations and documentation.

## Methodology

The project follows these key steps:
1. Data Loading: Load the Pokémon dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, convert data types, and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. Predictive Modeling: Build and evaluate machine learning models using scikit-learn to classify Pokémon as legendary or non-legendary.
5. Documentation: Document the analysis process, findings, and insights in Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown documents.

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals several key insights, including:
- Distribution of Pokémon attributes such as base stats, types, and generations.
- Correlations between different attributes and base stats.
- Trends in the capture rates of Pokémon.
- Differences in base stats between legendary and non-legendary Pokémon.
- Predictive modeling performance in classifying Pokémon based on their attributes.

## Conclusion

The Pokémon Dataset Analysis project provides valuable insights into the characteristics and classifications of Pokémon species. The findings can be useful for Pokémon enthusiasts, researchers, and anyone interested in data analysis and machine learning.
