Welcome to the Pokémon Dataset Analysis project! This repository contains code and resources for exploring the Pokémon dataset, uncovering interesting insights, and building predictive models to classify Pokémon as legendary or non-legendary based on their attributes.

## Overview

The Pokémon dataset includes various attributes for each Pokémon, such as name, types, base stats, abilities, and more. In this analysis, we aim to:

- Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize distributions of Pokémon attributes, identify patterns, and correlations in the data.
- Build predictive models using classification algorithms to classify Pokémon as legendary or non-legendary based on their attributes.
- Present findings with clear visualizations, descriptions, and documentation.

## Contents

- **Jupyter Notebook:** Explore the Pokémon dataset using Python code in a Jupyter Notebook.
- **Data.md:** Detailed information about the dataset, including attribute descriptions and data sources.
- **Images:** Visualizations and images generated during the analysis.
- **README.md:** You are here! An overview of the project, instructions for running the notebook, and other relevant information.

## Running the Notebook

To run the analysis notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`dose-of-data-soumyadip.ipynb`) using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
4. Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially to perform data analysis, visualization, and model building.
